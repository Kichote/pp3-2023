     * (created diagram should contain three classes). 
     * Assume that the bookcase can hold any number of books. 
     * When creating a class diagram, pay attention to the relationships between classes, 
     * taking into account that the book can exist independently of the bookcase. 
     * Mark the multiplicity in the class diagram. Then, based on the class diagram, 
     * write a program that allows books to be placed in and removed from the bookshelf. 
     * Display the bookcase contents.
    12.	Add a Chapter class to the diagram that you have created, 
    describing the chapter in a book (chapter title, number of pages, 
    starting page number). Assume that a book can contain any number of chapters. 
    What is the relationship between the book and chapters? Can a chapter exist 
    without a book? Then, modify the program for operating the bookshelf.
